- 👋 Hi, I’m @SJS404.
- 👀 I’m interested in computing and cybersecurity.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning It Support, Comptia A+, Cybersecurity, Linux & Python
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any small projects.

Currently i am working on my portfolio website of thing i have previously done, and hardcoding this in html5 and css3. I have done this before during a college course however this is my first attempt at a full scale website from scratch. I have previous used website builder such as GoDaddy, Wix and Wordpress, but this is my first hardcoding for a website so any feedback, or tips would be greatly appreciated.
